# TwitterTestApp

<p>Programming language: used kotlin cause it's a huge plus and app is small and simple.
But I personally prefer java cause I believe you can't write <b>very bad</b> code in java and it's more reliable standard.</p>
<p>Architecture: MVVM cause it's official google's way to build clean architecture in android.</p>
<p>DI: Was selected dagger2. Do not trust kodein too much and had not enough time to get into it</p>
<p>Didn't use fragmentless design. Never tried it before. I think it will have too much time to get into it
 and probably need to learn some framework. But hope will try it sometimes. I heard it's nice thing</p>
<p>Persistence: was selected Room. Never used it before but decided to try this official google thing. I liked it. Very awesome and simple! </p>
<p>Consuming Twitter's API: used twitter android kit. It's a well documented and tested lib. Unfortunately it use's retrofit without rx but the rest is ok.</p>
<p>Did't had enough time for unit testing especially spec. Wrote test for tweet timeline because it's probably most important part of app. Also test for dao class</p>
